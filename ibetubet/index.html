  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  <div class="card-panel">
  <p class="flow-text">I BET U BET is a "simple" game of chance that is truly based on luck, not skill. Two players, each starting with fifty points, choose two numbers between 1 and 10. The first number is their bet, and the second number is their guess as to what theiropponent will bet. <br>

  There are ten rounds in a game, If a player goes under ten points, their opponent wins. If they win the majority of the rounds, they win the jackpot.<br>

  Whichever player is closest to the guessing the other players bet amount wins the round, winning the opponent's bet amount minus the difference times their selected multiplier. The jackpot is raised by the total difference amount in each round. <br>

  <h2>Ties</h2>
  In the event of a tie, both players lose their bet amount to the jackpot, giving them the opportunity to still win it back by the end of the game.<br>

  <h2>Super-Tie</h2>
  <p>A super tie is when both players guess the exact bet amount of the other player. In these rare cases, they each win double their bet amount and the jackpot doubles as well. Sequential super-ties result in a multiplier; players win triple and the jackpot triples, and so on.
