            <p>Two players, each starting with fifty points, choose two numbers between 1 and 9. The first number is their bet, and the second number is their guess as to what their opponent will bet. There are ten rounds in a game, If a player goes under
              ten points, their opponent wins. If they win the majority of the rounds, they win the jackpot. Whichever player is closest to the guessing the other players bet amount wins the round, winning the opponent's bet amount minus the difference
              times their selected multiplier. The jackpot is raised by the total difference amount in each round. </p>

              the jackpot triples, and so on.
