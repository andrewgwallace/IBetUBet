# I Bet U Bet

I BET U BET is a "simple" game of chance that is truly based on luck, not skill. Two players, each starting with fifty points, choose two numbers between 1 and 10. The first number is their "bet", and the second number is what they think their opponent will bet.

## Rules of Play

There are ten rounds in a game. If a player loses all their points or wins the majority of the rounds, the game ends.

Whichever player is closest to the guessing the other players bet amount wins the round, winning the opponent's bet amount minus the difference times their selected multiplier. The jackpot is raised by the total difference amount in each round.

## Ties
In the event of a tie, both players lose their bet amount to the jackpot, giving them the opportunity to still win it back by the end of the game.

## Super-Tie
A super tie is when both players guess the exact bet amount of the other player. In these rare cases, they each win double their bet amount and the jackpot doubles as well. Sequential super-ties result in a multiplier; players win triple and the jackpot triples, and so on.


Future Game Features:
Should the game end 5-to-4, the loser has the option of "Betting it all" (the remainder of their points) to try get it to a tie game in the 10th round. If they win, both players enter "Sudden Death". The winner of the final round wins the jackpot and all the remaining points of their opponent.
