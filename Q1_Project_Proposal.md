I BET YOU BET

How to play: There are two players. Each player places two "bets". The first is their bet, the second is their guess as to what they think the other player will bet.

Winning: Best out of five (or ten...TBD).

The player that is closest in their guess of the other player's bet wins the round.

If both players guess each other's exact bet, the round ends in a tie.

Local Storage - A running list on the screen keeps count of who won each round.

Optional Expansion:

Points system: A player wins or loses points (their bet amount) each round.
Jackpot: An amount the winner receives in their bank after all rounds have been played.
Payout: If both players guess the exact amount of the other player, they both receive points.
Beneath the round result list is displayed the current standing winner.
Use of socket.io to allow two players to connect to play.
